# GitHub requires Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of password
# To push, you'll need to:
# 1. Create a PAT at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. When pushing, use the PAT as password
# 3. Or use SSH instead (see option 2 below)

# Current remote URL:
# https://che-manish@github.com/che-manish/irt-erp-v1.git

# To push with PAT:
# git push -u origin main
# (Enter username: che-manish, password: YOUR_PAT)
